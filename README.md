# Image Optimizer for SPE

The current version of the module makes use of the online service https://compressor.io to shrink the images.

## Getting Started

* Ensure that Sitecore PowerShell Extensions 5.0 or later is installed.
* Install the Image Optimizer package found in the repo.
* Profit!

## Using the Module

The module provides two ways to optimize. The first is through the context menu while selecting an image. The second can through a report, which supports filtering by media size.

### Context Menu

### Report Menu

The following are included with SPE 5.0 and should be used to help aid finding large images.
