# Image Optimizer for SPE

The current version of the module makes use of the online service https://compressor.io to shrink the images.

## Getting Started

* Ensure that Sitecore PowerShell Extensions 4.7 or later is installed.
* Install the Image Optimizer package found in the repo.
* Profit!

## Using the Module

The module provides two ways to optimize. The first is through the context menu while selecting an image. The second can through a report, which supports filtering by media size.
